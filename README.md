## Project6 -> Model Analysis and Selection Project for Prostate-Specific Antigen (lpsa) Prediction

This project aims to develop accurate and robust predictive models for predicting the level of prostate-specific antigen (lpsa) from various clinical variables. PSA is a crucial biomarker used to assess the risk of prostate cancer. The data used are from the study by Stamey et al. (1989) and include variables such as the log of cancer volume, log of prostate weight, age, and other relevant clinical features. The project begins with a data exploration phase, including visualization of distributions, checking for missing values, and normalization of variables to ensure data quality before modeling. Several techniques are then applied, including classical linear models, model selection methods, regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net), as well as partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR). Each method is evaluated with different configurations to ensure model optimality. Cross-validation techniques are used to select the best hyperparameters and evaluate the predictive performances of each model. The goal is to compare these approaches to identify the most effective and applicable method in a clinical context for predicting lpsa level.This project aims to develop accurate and robust predictive models for predicting the level of prostate-specific antigen (lpsa) from various clinical variables.

## Project7 -> Model Analysis and Selection Project for Prostate-Specific Antigen (lpsa) Prediction

This study compares various algorithms for solving the N-Queens problem, a classic problem in artificial intelligence. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N × N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other, according to the rules of chess. The problem is formalized as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

Objectives:

Formalize the N-Queens problem as a CSP.
Implement and compare the AC3 algorithm, depth-first search with backtracking, and Forward checking algorithm.
Analyze the results and draw conclusions.This study compares various algorithms for solving the N-Queens problem, a classic problem in artificial intelligence.

## Project10 -> Decision-Making Tool under Uncertainty: A Python Flask Web Application

This project, developed during my university studies, involved creating a web application using Python Flask to aid in decision-making under uncertainty. The tool allows users to input decision criteria and weights for each criterion. It then computes the decision outcome using methods such as maximin, maximax, Laplace, Bernoulli, Hurwicz, and minimax regret. This enables users to compare outcomes and make informed decisions.This project, developed during my university studies, involved creating a web application using Python Flask to aid in decision-making under uncertainty.

## Project12 -> 3rd Prize Winners - Airbnb and 2024 Olympic Games Hackathon

Our team was awarded the 3rd prize at a hackathon focused on Airbnb and the 2024 Olympic Games. The challenge for participating teams was to propose improvements to the user experience on Airbnb, integrating Geographic Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Host Profile Study. Our approach included understanding travelers' preferences based on location, past habits, and activities they enjoyed in a specific region, proposing experiences tailored to user interests while considering factors such as weather, sports events, and tourist activities developed around them. Additionally, we suggested implementing a search function based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to allow users to find accommodations using more natural and conversational queries. We also analyzed listing descriptions and user reviews to understand the most important features and amenities for each traveler, refining search results accordingly. We extracted the requirements requested by the tenants and conducted a sentimental analysis to categorize them with their requirements
